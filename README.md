# Introduction-to-Internet
University of Oulu's Introduction to Internet course work.

Program creates an TCP-connection with a server and sends encryption keys for it. Then the program creates an UDP-connection between itself and a server to exchange data, encryption keys are used to encrypt and decrypt this data. Server was designed to reply to correctly built messages. Program at the server end was not implemented by us.

Program is created in collaboration with Mikko Pulli, Valtteri Kinnunen, Benjamin Mustonen and Arttu Meril√§inen. Some parts of the code are provided by the course staff. I don't exactly know who created those small parts since no one told.
